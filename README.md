## controller-runtime Deployment Controller

- Integrated [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) into the project.
- Added a deployment controller that logs each reconcile event for Deployments in the default namespace.
- The controller is started alongside the FastHTTP server.

**What it does:**
- Uses controller-runtime's manager to run a controller for Deployments.
- Logs every reconcile event (creation, update, deletion) for Deployments.

**Usage:**
```sh
git switch feature/step9-controller-runtime

go run main.go --log-level trace --kubeconfig  ~/.kube/config server
```
